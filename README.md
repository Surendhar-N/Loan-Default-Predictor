# Loan-Default-Predictor

Loan Defaulter Prediction.ipynb is a python note book file to construct an algorithm to predict whether the given user profile will be a loan defaulter or not. Test.rar and Train.rar are two files which are used to train and test algorithm respectively. We have developed two alogorithm, one based on logistic regression and another one based on random forest classifier, Result and Result_rf are the results of both the algorithms respectively.
